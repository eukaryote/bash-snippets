=============
Bash Snippets
=============

A collection of simple Bash scripts that illustrate various aspects of Bash and
shell scripting.

The primary purpose of these scripts is for me to document what I learn when I
look something up for the first (or fiftieth) time and condense that into a
simple example that I can easily find later, as well as to have a convenient
starting point for further interactive experimentation when additional
questions arise.
